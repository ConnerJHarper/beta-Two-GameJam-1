  statement: "Your friend tells you that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing
    with his life. He feels like he\u2019s lost and he has nothing to look forward
    to, and sometimes he doesn\u2019t see the point. He feels adrift, like he goes
    day by day accomplishing nothing. This is the first you\u2019re hearing of this
    from him, and you\u2019re not sure what to say."
